<section class="ehw-doc-descr">

These are my personal notes on **Chapter 1: Intro in Learn to Code in Python** from Boot.dev. This chapter covers the basics of writing and running Python code, starting with fixing a simple bug and using the `console`. It introduces what **Python** is used for, explains what **code** means, and explores how to write **multiple instructions**. Key concepts like **syntax** and **syntax errors** are emphasized.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L1: Welcome to Learn Python


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L2: Fix Your First Bug


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L3: The Console


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L4: What Is Python?


- https://www.python.org/
- https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology

- Python is known for: 

  - Backend web servers
  - DevOps and cloud engineering
  - Machine learning
  - Scripting and automation

  - Being simple to read and write
  
- Not well-known for:  frontend development or graphical user interfaces. It's possible, but not common.


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L5: What Is Python?


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L6: What Is 'Code'?


- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L7: Multiple Instructions


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L8: Syntax Errors



> "Syntax" is jargon for "valid code that the computer can understand".

STopped here: https://www.boot.dev/lessons/366f2438-8f95-4f24-a55c-156a4544b83e (09/25/25)


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L9: Syntax Errors Quiz

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)

 in Python, the following is correct syntax:

 ```py
print("hello world")
 ```

Other types of errors besides syntax errors:

- **A bug in your logic**: Your code is valid, and will run, but it _does something unexpected._
- It's **too slow**. Your code is valid and does what's expected, but it does it slowly

What happens if you try to run code with invalid syntax?

- You'll get an error message from the Python interpreter and the code won't execute

<span class="boot-dev-op">Boot.dev Instructions:</span>

- **Run:** For testing and debugging. There is no penalty for running your code.
- **Submit:** Runs your code, but also checks its output against our answer key. If the output doesn't match, you'll be punished.
- 
> üí°**Pro tip:** You wouldn't deploy code to end users without testing... right? So don't submit code without running it first! The goal of this game mechanic is to encourage good real-world coding practices. "Submit" is like deploying to production.

**What's the Penalty?**
When you fail a lesson, one of two things will happen:

- If you have [armor](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/142c8a73-5ede-49a6-9460-563890646023#), you'll lose one. That armor is consumed to protect you from future failures on that lesson.
- If you don't have an armor, you'll lose your [sharpshooter spree](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/142c8a73-5ede-49a6-9460-563890646023#), and it will reset to zero. Each time your spree counter hits 15, you'll earn a random chest. Chests contain gems and items (like armor).
