### ▶️ L1: Loops


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

# Loops

Loops are a programmer's best friend. Loops allow us to do the same operation multiple times without having to write it explicitly each time.

For example, let's pretend I want to print the numbers 0-9.

I could do this:

```py
print(0)
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
```

Even so, it would save me a lot of time typing to use a _loop_. Especially if I wanted to do the same thing _one thousand_ or _one million_ times.

A _"for loop"_ in Python is written like this:

```py
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)
```

`i` replaces the numbers `0` to `9`. In English, the code says:

1.  Start with `i` equals `0`. (`i in range(0)`)
2.  If `i` is not less than 10 (`range(0, 10)`), exit the loop. Else:
    *   Print `i` to the console. (`print(i)`)
    *   Add `1` to `i`. (`range` defaults to incrementing by 1)
    *   Go back to step `2`.

The result is that the numbers `0-9` are logged to the console in order.

> ℹ️ The numbers `a`, `b` in `range(a, b)` are _inclusive_ of `a` and _exclusive_ of `b`.  
So `range(0, 10)` includes `0` but not `10`.

## Whitespace Matters in Python!

> ℹ️ The body of a for-loop _must_ be indented, otherwise you'll get a syntax error.

### ▶️ L6: Whitespace in Python


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>


The body of a for-loop _must_ be indented, otherwise you'll get a syntax error. Not only that, but every line in the body of the loop must be indented in the same way - we use the "4 spaces" convention. Pressing the `<tab>` key should automatically insert 4 spaces.

_Whitespace matters in Python._

</section>

<BR>

> 💡**TIP**: *Python uses the `4 spaces` convention for indentation.*


### ▶️ L7: Range Continued

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>


The `range()` function we've been using in our `for` loops actually has an optional 3rd parameter: the "step".

```py
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
# prints:
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
```

The "step" parameter determines how much to add to `i` in each iteration of the loop. You can even go backwards:

```py
for i in range(3, 0, -1):
    print(i)
# prints:
# 3
# 2
# 1
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

Fix the `for` loop in the `count_down` function. It takes `start` and `end` inputs, but `start` is always greater than `end`. It's supposed to print numbers counting down, beginning at `start` (_inclusive_) and stopping just before `end` (_exclusive_), but there's a mistake in the `range` function call.

## Tip

In the programming world, it's common for the first number in a range to be _inclusive_ and the second number is _exclusive_. e.g. `range(0, 10)` will include:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

    print(f"Printing numbers from {start} to {end + 1}:")
    count_down(start, end)
    print("=====================================")


def main():
    test(10, 0)
    test(20, 10)
    test(15, 11)

def count_down(start, end):
    for i in range(start, end, -1):
        print(i)


# Don't edit below this line


def test(start, end):

### ▶️ L8: Sum Game

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Remember you can use in-place operators to increase or decrease a variable by any amount.

```py
number_of_enemies = 10
number_of_enemies += 2
# number_of_enemies is 12
```

```py
number_of_enemies = 10
number_of_enemies -= 2
# number_of_enemies is 8
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Fix the bug in the `sum_of_numbers` function. Instead of adding 1 to `total` at each iteration of the loop, it should add `i`. For example, instead of:

`1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1...`

we want:

`0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...`

The desired output is a single number after the loop has finished executing.

<span class="boot-dev-op">Live: Search for Challenges:</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

Good afternoon fellow learners! I wanted to let you know that you can now search for existing challenges in the training grounds to jump straight in to top-rated premade challenges. If waiting for boots to generate a new challenge takes too long, or you just want to be sure that other students already vetted the challenge and its a good one - the new search bar is for you! Check it out in the [**training grounds**](https://www.boot.dev/training)

> NOTE: *This was from my achievement notifications, not this chapter*

</section>

<span class="boot-dev-op">Training Grounds:</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### What are the Training Grounds?

The Training Grounds is a place to **review and practice** what you've learned in the courses. It's an "infinite" series of dynamically generated challenges **personalized to you**.

- - -

##### How are the challenges generated?

Using AI! That said, we've hand-written thousands of challenges, and used those to seed these newly generated ones - it's not just one-shot slop. The generation loop is an agentic system that takes the following into account:

*   [**Spaced repetition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition): We use a time-variable algorithm to surface topics you may need a refresher on.
*   **Personalization**: We try to only give you challenges that require knowledge you've already learned.
*   **Mastery**: We weight toward topics that you struggled with in the past.
*   **Correctness**: Our system runs the challenges to ensure generated solutions work before you start.
*   **Variety**: There are 3 types of challenges: write the code, fix the bug, and interview question.

- - -

##### How do custom instructions work?

If you _don't_ enter a custom prompt, you'll get a challenge based solely on your learning history. If you _do_ enter a custom prompt, we'll still use your history, but the system will override any of its choices with your instructions if they contradict.
- - -

##### How do the game-mechanics work?

Game mechanics like streaks, quests, sharpshooter etc. all work the same way in the Training Grounds as they do in the courses, but the base XP gain of challenges is 25% lower than in regular courses. Additionally, XP gain is reduced by 5% per challenge to a maximum of -50% per day.

- - -

##### What if the challenges are bad?

Challenges are AI generated, so occasionally you'll get some weird stuff, even with all the safeguards, prompts, tests, and hand-crafted examples we've put in place. Be sure to use the star ratings and skip button to give us feedback so that we can keep improving the system.

- **game lobby**: A virtual staging area in multiplayer games where players gather before gameplay to chat, form teams, set game options, and prepare for the match. It functions as a coordinated communication and organization space distinct from free-for-all chatrooms, fostering social interaction, strategy planning, and team readiness.

- **tuple**: an ordered collection of items in python that can't be changed after creation, often used to store fixed groups of values like coordinates or settings. Items can be any type and are enclosed in parentheses, separated by commas (*while common across languages their **size, element types, mutability, and syntax differ**.*)



<section class="challenge callout"><span class="label-challenge">CHALLENGE:  Build Player Handle 👇🏽</span>

Complete the `build_player_handle` function.

You work on a game lobby system. Given a player's first name, last name, and a tag number, build two strings:

1.  A display name in the format: `"Last, First"`
2.  A short handle made from the first letter of the first name, the first letter of the last name, a dash, and the tag number: `"FL-7"`

Requirements:

*   Use multiple variable assignment to swap the first and last names before formatting the display name. For example: `a, b = b, a` assigns `b` to `a` and `a` to `b` in one line.
*   Use an [f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-f-strings) to build both strings. F-strings let you write strings like `f"Hello {name}"` where `{name}` is replaced by the variable's value.
*   Return a tuple: `(display_name, handle)`.

Important details about the handle:

*   The handle must use the first letter of the (original) first name followed by the first letter of the (original) last name, then a dash and the tag number. For example, for `first_name='Luke'`, `last_name='Skywalker'`, and `tag_number=7` the handle should be `"LS-7"`.

Examples:

```py
print(build_player_handle("Leia", "Organa", 24))
# ("Organa, Leia", "LO-24")

print(build_player_handle("Luke", "Skywalker", 7))
# ("Skywalker, Luke", "LS-7")
```
