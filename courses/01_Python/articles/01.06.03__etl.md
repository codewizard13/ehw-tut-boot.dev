Great question — and you’re about to learn one of the most important ideas in data work 👇

## 🧩 What ETL Means

**ETL** stands for:

> **E**xtract → **T**ransform → **L**oad

It describes the **three main steps** of moving and preparing data between systems —
for example, when you migrate data, build reports, or load information into a database.

---

### 1. 🧲 **Extract**

**Get the data** from where it currently lives.

* Could be a database, a spreadsheet, a website, a log file, or an API.
* Example: reading a CSV file in Python with `pandas.read_csv()` or `open()`.

🧠 Think: *“Where does the data come from?”*

---

### 2. 🧮 **Transform**

**Clean, convert, or reshape** the data so it fits your needs.

* Fix inconsistent formats
* Convert data types (like your binary → integer example!)
* Combine or split columns
* Filter out bad data

🧠 Think: *“What needs to change so the data makes sense?”*

---

### 3. 📦 **Load**

**Put the prepared data** into its new home.

* Could be a database, a new file, a cloud system, or a dashboard.
* Example: saving with `to_csv()`, or inserting into a SQL table.

🧠 Think: *“Where should this data live now?”*

### 🔄 Example in Miniature (with Python)

Let’s connect it to your binary-string example:

```python
# EXTRACT
binary_strings = ["1010", "1101", "100000"]

# TRANSFORM
integers = [int(b, 2) for b in binary_strings]

# LOAD
with open("integers.txt", "w") as f:
    for num in integers:
        f.write(str(num) + "\n")
```

✅ You just did ETL!

* **Extract**: read binary strings
* **Transform**: convert to integers
* **Load**: save results to a file

So in short:

> **ETL** = the data journey from *raw → clean → usable.*
