Perfect example 👌 — this is a *tiny* but very real form of **data migration**:
you’re converting data from one **representation** (binary strings) into another **type** (integers).

Let’s walk through this **step-by-step for a novice** 👇

---

### 🧩 The Goal

You have data like this:

```python
binary_strings = ["1010", "1101", "100000"]
```

These look like binary numbers (1s and 0s), but they’re actually **strings**.
You want to “migrate” (convert) them into the actual **integers** they represent.

---

### 🧠 The Idea

Binary means **base 2** — each digit represents a power of 2.

Example:
`"1010"` = 1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 0×1 = **10**

Python can do that conversion for you using the built-in function **`int()`** with a base argument.

---

### ✅ The Simple Conversion

```python
binary_string = "1010"
integer_value = int(binary_string, 2)
print(integer_value)
```

**Output:**

```
10
```

Here:

* `binary_string` is your old data format (a string)
* `int(binary_string, 2)` is the *transformation step*
* `integer_value` is the new format (integer)

---

### 🔄 Migrating a Whole List

You can migrate an entire list like this:

```python
binary_strings = ["1010", "1101", "100000"]

integers = [int(b, 2) for b in binary_strings]

print(integers)
```

**Output:**

```
[10, 13, 32]
```

---

### ⚙️ Adding Safety (for messy data)

If you’re not sure all strings are valid binary numbers, you can handle errors gracefully:

```python
binary_strings = ["1010", "xyz", "1001"]

integers = []
for b in binary_strings:
    try:
        integers.append(int(b, 2))
    except ValueError:
        print(f"⚠️ Skipping invalid binary string: {b}")

print(integers)
```

**Output:**

```
⚠️ Skipping invalid binary string: xyz
[10, 9]
```

---

### 🗂️ Why this is a data migration

Even though it’s small-scale:

* You’re **extracting** binary strings from your data source
* **Transforming** them into integers
* (Optionally) **loading** them into a new structure or file

That’s the ETL pattern — just at a beginner-friendly level.

Would you like me to show how to **save the converted integers to a new file** (like a simple CSV)? That would complete the “load” step of the migration.
