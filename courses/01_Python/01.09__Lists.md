### ▶️ L1: Lists

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

A natural way to organize and store data is in a `List`. Some languages call them "arrays", but in Python we just call them lists. Think of all the apps you use and how many of the items in the app are organized into lists.

For example:

*   An X (formerly Twitter) feed is a list of posts
*   An online store is a list of products
*   The state of a chess game is a list of moves
*   This list is a list of things that are lists

Lists in Python are declared using square brackets, with commas separating each item:

```py
inventory = ["Iron Breastplate", "Healing Potion", "Leather Scraps"]
```

Lists can contain items of any data type, in our example above we have a `List` of strings.

</section>

<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *Lists can contain items of any data type*

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Let's work on Fantasy Quest's inventory! We can store items the player is carrying in a list!

Fix our `get_inventory` function by adding `Shortsword` to the end of the list.

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def get_inventory():
    return ["Healing Potion", "Leather Scraps", "Iron Helmet"]


# Don't edit below this line


def test():
    inventory = get_inventory()
    print(f"Inventory contains: {inventory}")
    print("=====================================")

### ▶️ L2: Lists Continued

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Sometimes when we're manually creating lists it can be hard to read if all the items are on the same line of code. We can declare the list using multiple lines if we want to:

```py
flower_types = [
    "daffodil",
    "rose",
    "chrysanthemum"
]

player_ages = [
    23,
    18,
    31,
    42
]
```

Writing it this way helps with readability and organization, especially if there are many items or if some of the items are too long. Keep in mind this is just a styling change. The code will run correctly either way.

</section>


### ▶️ L3: Lists Continued


### ▶️ L4: Counting in Programming

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

In the world of programming, counting is a bit strange!

We don't start counting at `1`, we start at `0` instead.

## Indexes

Each item in a list has an index that refers to its spot in the list.

Take the following list as an example:

```py
names = ["Bob", "Lane", "Alice", "Breanna"]
```

*   Index 0: `Bob`
*   Index 1: `Lane`
*   Index 2: `Alice`
*   Index 3: `Breanna`

</section>


<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *Python lists are `zero-indexed`*


### ▶️ L5: Indexing Into Lists

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

# Indexing Into Lists

Now that we know how to create new lists, we need to know how to access specific items in the list.

We access items in a list directly by using their _index_. Indexes start at 0 (the first item) and increment by one with each successive item. The syntax is as follows:

```py
best_languages = ["JavaScript", "Go", "Rust", "Python", "C"]
print(best_languages[1])
# prints "Go", because index 1 was provided
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

We need to allow our players to access items in their inventories!

Fix our `get_leather_scraps` function by changing the value of `item_index` to the index in `inventory` that holds the value "Leather Scraps".

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def get_leather_scraps():
    inventory = [
        "Healing Potion",
        "Leather Scraps",
        "Iron Helmet",
        "Bread",
        "Shortsword",
    ]

    item_index = 0

    return inventory[item_index]
```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
def get_leather_scraps():
    inventory = [
        "Healing Potion",
        "Leather Scraps",
        "Iron Helmet",
        "Bread",
        "Shortsword",
    ]

    item_index = 1

    return inventory[item_index]
```

</section><!-- END .assignment-answer-sec -->

### ▶️ L6: List Length

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

The length of a List can be calculated using the `len()` function.

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pear"]
length = len(fruits)
# 3
```

The length of the list is equal to the number of items present. Don't be fooled by the fact that the length is not equal to the index of the last element; in fact, it will always be one greater.

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Some of our player's inventories are huge, so looking through the entire list is cumbersome. Let's find an easy way for us to get the index of the last item in their inventory.

Complete the `get_last_index` function so that it returns the length of the `inventory` list minus 1.

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def get_last_index(inventory):
    pass
```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
def get_last_index(inventory):
    return len(inventory) - 1
```

**📈 OUTPUT RESULTS**

```sh
---------------------------------

============= PASS ==============
3 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped
```

</section><!-- END .assignment-answer-sec -->

### ▶️ L7: List Updates

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

We can also change the item that exists at a given index. For example, we can change `Leather` to `Leather Armor` in the `inventory` list in the following way:

```py
inventory = ["Leather", "Iron Ore", "Healing Potion"]
inventory[0] = "Leather Armor"
# inventory: ['Leather Armor', 'Iron Ore', 'Healing Potion']
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

Fantasy Quest is trialing a new inventory system for their hardcore game mode. If a player has `Iron Ore` or an `Iron Bar`, it is always stored in the 2nd inventory slot (and they can only have one or the other).

Let's finish the `smelt_ore` function:

1.  [ ] Check if they have `Iron Ore` in the second inventory slot.
2.  [ ] If they do, change it into an `Iron Bar`.


</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def smelt_ore(inventory):
    # ?

    return inventory
```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
# NOTE: This is basically a replace algorithm
def smelt_ore(inventory):
    
    if inventory[1] == "Iron Ore":
        inventory[1] = "Iron Bar"

    return inventory
```

</section><!-- END .assignment-answer-sec -->

### ▶️ L8: Appending in Python

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

It's common to create an empty list then fill it with values using a loop. We can add values to the end of a list using the `.append()` method:

```py
cards = []
cards.append("nvidia")
cards.append("amd")
# the cards list is now ['nvidia', 'amd']
```

</section>

<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *Initialize empty lists like this: `cards = []`*
>
> 💡 **TIP**: *Push values on the list with the `.append()` method*

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

We need to generate a unique user ID for each player in the game. An ID is just a unique number that _identifies_ a user.

Let's finish the `generate_user_list` function. In the body of the loop, use the incrementing value `i` as unique IDs and append them to the `player_ids` list.


</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def generate_user_list(num_of_users):
    player_ids = []

    for i in range(0, num_of_users):
        pass

    return player_ids

```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
def generate_user_list(num_of_users):
    player_ids = []

    for i in range(0, num_of_users):
        player_ids.append(i)

    return player_ids
```

</section><!-- END .assignment-answer-sec -->

### ▶️ L9: Pop Values

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

`.pop()` is the opposite of `.append()`. Pop removes the last element from a list and returns it for use. For example:

```py
vegetables = ["broccoli", "cabbage", "kale", "tomato"]
last_vegetable = vegetables.pop()
# vegetables = ['broccoli', 'cabbage', 'kale']
# last_vegetable = 'tomato'
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Our player is selling the items in their inventory to the shopkeep!

Pop the last element from the `inventory` list until there is nothing left. Pop the elements into an `item` variable so that each prints in turn on line `19`.

## Note

While `.pop()` typically removes the last item of a list, it can also be used to remove an item at a specific index. For example, `vegetables.pop(1)` would remove `"cabbage"` from the list. This can be useful when you need to remove items from other positions in your list.

</section>

<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *Use `.pop(index)` to remove an item from a specific position in a list, not just the last one.*

### ▶️ L10: Counting the Items in a List

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Remember that we can [iterate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iterate) over all the elements in a list using a loop. For example, the following code will print each item in the `sports` list.

```py
for i in range(0, len(sports)):
    print(sports[i])
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within their inventory!

Let's finish the `get_item_counts` function.

1.  [ ] Within the loop, check if the items are a `Potion`, `Bread`, or `Shortsword`.
2.  [ ] If you find a match, increment the corresponding counter, either `potion_count`, `bread_count` or `shortsword_count`.

## Tip

The example shows you how to access the values in a list. Combine this with what you know about comparison and assignment operators to complete the assignment.


</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def get_item_counts(items):

    bread_count = 0
    shortsword_count = 0

    # don't touch above this line

    for i in range(0, len(items)):
        pass

    # don't touch below this line

    return potion_count, bread_count, shortsword_count

```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
def get_item_counts(items):
    potion_count = 0
    bread_count = 0
    shortsword_count = 0

    # don't touch above this line

    for i in range(0, len(items)):

        print(f"items[i]: {items[i]}")
        
        # Check if item is Potion, Bread, or Shortsword
        if items[i] == "Potion":
            potion_count += 1
        elif items[i] == "Bread":
            bread_count += 1
        elif items[i] == "Shortsword":
            shortsword_count += 1

    # don't touch below this line

    return potion_count, bread_count, shortsword_count
```

</section><!-- END .assignment-answer-sec -->

### ▶️ L11: No-Index Syntax

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

In my opinion, Python has _the most elegant_ syntax for iterating directly over the items in a list without worrying about index numbers. If you don't need the index number you can use the following syntax:

```py
trees = ['oak', 'pine', 'maple']
for tree in trees:
    print(tree)
# Prints:
# oak
# pine
# maple
```

`tree`, the variable declared using the `in` keyword, directly accesses the value in the list rather than the index of the value. If we don't need to update the item and only need to access its value then this is a more clean way to write the code.

</section>

<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *In Python the `for-in` looping syntax is similar to `foreach` in PHP*


### ▶️ L12: No-Index Syntax

### ▶️ L13: Find an Item in a List

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Practice the "no-index" or "no-range" syntax:

```py
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

We need to check if a player has a specific item in their inventory. In the `contains_leather_scraps` function, use the no-index syntax to iterate over each item in `items`. If you find an item called `Leather Scraps`, set the `found` variable to `True`.


</section>

### ▶️ L14: Find the Increase


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Every day, character levels are recorded in a list. When someone levels up, we congratulate them! Your assignment is to compare the levels to identify which characters need to be congratulated!

Complete the loop inside `check_character_levels`. It already loops over all of the indexes `i` in `old_character_levels`. The `old_character_levels` and `new_character_levels` lists are the same length, which means you can use `i` to index into both.

1.  [ ] For each iteration, use `i` with bracket notation to get the items at the _same index_ from both lists.
2.  [ ] Check if the level in `old_character_levels` is _less than_ the level in the `new_character_levels`.
3.  [ ] If so, print `i`. (Do not print anything if they didn't level up or somehow leveled down.)

For example, if the lists are:

```py
old_character_levels = [2, 5, 3, 7, 5]
new_character_levels = [2, 5, 19, 7, 8]
```

Then your code would print these indexes:

```bash
2
4
```
