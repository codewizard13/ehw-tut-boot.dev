<section class="ehw-doc-descr">


These are my personal notes on **functions in Python** from Boot.dev. This chapter covers defining and calling `functions`, using multiple parameters, `default` values, `None` returns, and the difference between **printing** and **returning**. It also touches on function order, scope, and returning multiple values — all key to writing clean, modular code.

### ▶️ L1: Functions


- **functions**: allow us to reuse and organize code; helps organize your code into smaller, modular pieces (**modular code**)
- **argument**: aka: input, parameter
- **def**: keyword for defining functions in Python

Ex:

```py
def area_of_circle(r):
    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result

# Function is reusable:
area = area_of_circle(6)
print(area)
# 113.04

area = area_of_circle(7)
print(area)
# 153.86
```




### ▶️ L2: Function Review


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Copied verbatim from the course 👇🏽</span>

Let's break down this function line by line so you can understand every nook and cranny of it.

```py
def area_of_circle(r):
    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result

radius = 5
area = area_of_circle(radius)
print(area)
# 78.5
```

Here's a chronological explanation of what happens when the above code is executed:

1. `def area_of_circle(r)`

The `area_of_circle` function is defined for later use, but not called. It accepts a single input, the arbitrarily named `r`. The body of the function (`pi = 3.14.`.. etc) is ignored for now.

2. `radius = 5`
A new variable called `radius` is created and set to the value `5`.

3. `area_of_circle(radius)`
   
The `area_of_circle` function is called with `radius` (in this case 5) as the input. Finally, we jump back to the function definition.

4. `def area_of_circle(r):`

We will now start executing the body of the function, and `r` is set to `5`.

5. `pi = 3.14`

A new variable called `pi` is created with a value of `3.14`.

6. `result = pi * r * r`

Some simple math is evaluated (`3.14 * 5 * 5`) and stored in the `result` variable.

7. `return result`

The result variable is returned from the function as output.

8. `area = area_of_circle(radius)`

The returned value is stored in a new variable called `area` (in this case `78.5`).

9. `print(area)`

The value of `area` is printed to the console.

### ▶️ L4: Multiple Parameters



Functions can have multiple **parameters** (_inputs_)

By default, when you call a function with positional arguments, it's **the argument's position that determines which parameter receives it**. The first argument goes to the first parameter, the second to the second, and so on.

Ex:

```py
def create_introduction(name, age, height, weight):
    first_part = "Your name is " + name + " and you are " + age + " years old."
    second_part = "You are " + height + " meters tall and weigh " + weight + " kilograms."
    full_intro = first_part + " " + second_part
    return full_intro
```

It can be called like this:

```py
my_name = "John"
my_age = "30"

intro = create_introduction(my_name, my_age, "1.8", "80")
print(intro)
# Your name is John and you are 30 years old. You are 1.8 meters tall and weigh 80 kilograms.
```

### ▶️ L5: Printing vs. Returning

- **print()**: prints a value to console; does not return any values
- **return**: ends current function's execution and provides value(s) to the caller function; does not print anything to the console


<section class="info-banner"><span style="font-weight:700">💡 Printing to Debug Your Code</span>

Printing values and running your code is a great way to debug your code. You can see what values are stored in various variables, find your mistakes, and fix them. Add print statements and run your code as you go! It's a great habit to get into to make sure that each line you write is doing what you expect it to do.

</section>

<span class="boot-dev-op">Boot.dev Instructions:</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

In the real world it's rare to leave `print()` statements in your code when you're done debugging. Similarly, you need to remember to remove any `print()` statements from your code before submitting your work here on Boot.dev because it will interfere with the tests!


</section>

### ▶️ L6: Where to Declare Functions

The following code doesn't work because the variable is called (`print()`) before it is defined,

```py
print(my_name)
my_name = 'Lane Wagner'
# NameError: 'my_name' is not defined
```

Similarly, the following function doesn't work because `main()` is being called **before it is defined** in the code. In Python, functions must be defined **before** they are called — there is no concept of **hoisting** as in JavaScript, where function declarations are automatically moved ("hoisted") to the top of their scope during interpretation.:

```py
main()  # ❌ NameError: name 'main' is not defined

def main():
    print("Hello")

```

The result is a runtime error:

<section class="error-banner">Error:

```sh
PythonError: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<exec>", line 16, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'main' is not defined
```

</section>

<br>

Therefore, to fix it we should move the `main()` call **after** the function definition:

```py
def main():
    print("Hello")

main()  # ✅ Works fine
```

In Python, functions must be defined <b><i>before</i></b> they are called
</section>


### ▶️ L7: Order of Functions


> 💡 To keep things organized, most developers **define all functions first**, then call `main()` at the end — ensuring Python has processed all definitions before execution begins.

> 💡 The entry point is typically called `main` by convention

Here's an example of a program with functions and entry point ordered properly:

```py
def main():
    health = 10
    armor = 5
    add_armor(health, armor)

def add_armor(h, a):
    new_health = h + a
    print_health(new_health)

def print_health(new_health):
    print(f"The player now has {new_health} health")

# call entrypoint last
main()
```

### ▶️ L9: Community

> 💡 **Getting help** is a **_critical part_** of learning to code (even in your day-to-day work as a developer)!

<span class="boot-dev-op">Discord:</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

**Boots** and your **spellbook** are great first lines of defense when it comes to getting help. But, when you absolutely need a human instead, Boot.dev has an amazing [**Discord**](https://www.boot.dev/community) community full of helpful devs and fellow students eager to lend a hand.

- Click the "Community" tab below the lesson text (by Boots and the spellbook)
- Join the Boot.dev Discord server and sync your account
- With your account linked up, you'll be able to chat with other learners and mentors, as well as use the `#help...` forums to ask questions. Also, _**if you help others in the Discord, you'll get Karma which will help you earn [fellowship achievements](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/0f4fa755-1ce7-468b-bf34-c1460e97bf28#).**_
- Finally, check out the list of other recommended communities in the "Communities" tab. These are great places to hang out online... replace your junk-food social media with some great coding communities!

**Formula to Calculate Temperature (Fahrenheit to Celsius)**:

```
5/9 * (f - 32)
```

Here's my answer to creating a `to_celsius()` function in Python:

```py
def to_celsius(f):
    c = (5/9) * (f - 32)
    return c

# Testing to validate function:

def test(f):
    c = round(to_celsius(f), 2)
    print(f, "degrees fahrenheit is", c, "degrees celsius")

test(100)
test(88)
test(104)
test(112)
```

### ▶️ L10: Boots Interview

<span class="boot-dev-op">Boots Interview:</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

t's time for your first [Boots interview](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/dcafd50a-c53f-4a1a-8677-faf551ce4568#) lesson!

In these lessons, Boots turns on you, becoming your interviewer rather than just your tutor. He asks you an open-ended question, and you chat back and forth with him until he feels you've covered the points that the instructor has asked for.

- ⚠️ **If you ask follow up questions**, he'll clarify and **you will not be penalized**
- ⚠️ **If you give a partially correct answer**, you'll be asked to continue and **will not be penalized**
- ⛔ **If you say something that's wrong**, you'll **lose an armor/spree**
- ✅ Once you've covered all the points correctly, you'll pass

</section>


### ▶️ L11: Solutions

<span class="boot-dev-op">Instructor Solutions:</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

Okay, I just need to tell you about one last resource you have when you're stuck. Every lesson on Boot.dev has an [**instructor solution**](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/6b3ce0b8-b323-4685-bf50-48cfd1c9959d#) that you can view!

- 💸 Like Boots, solutions come at a cost... a steeper one in fact. _**If you view a solution before you complete the lesson, you'll lose all the XP for that lesson.**_ Well, unless you use a **seer stone** - in which case you won't lose any XP. Though you will be down a seer stone.

- 🆓 Just like it's free to use Boots after a lesson is complete, **viewing a solution after you've completed the lesson is free** as well. In fact, we encourage you to frequently check your work against ours, often times there's something to learn from the differences.

- **View solutions sparingly**. If you find yourself using the solution before completion more than about once per chapter you should <u>_consider slowing down_</u>, <u>_asking for help in the discord_</u>, and even <u>_resetting lessons and trying them again_</u> to build a stronger foundation.

### ▶️ L12: None Return


- **none return**: - When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return `None`. For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console, but doesn't explicitly return a value. 

The following code snippets all return the same value, `None`:

```py
def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
    return None
```

```py
def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
    return
```

```py
def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
```


### ▶️ L13: None Return
