### ▶️ L1: Dictionaries

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

[Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) in Python are used to store data values in `key` -> `value` pairs. Dictionaries are a great way to store groups of information.

```python
# use curly braces
# add key-value pairs
car = {
  "brand": "Toyota",
  "model": "Camry",
  "year": 2019,
}
```

Here the `car` variable is assigned to a dictionary `{}` containing the keys `brand`, `model` and `year`. The keys' corresponding values are `Toyota`, `Camry` and `2019`.

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

Complete the `get_character_record` function. It takes a character's `name`, `server`, `level`, and `rank` as individual inputs, and returns a dictionary with the following string keys:

*   `"name"`
*   `"server"`
*   `"level"`
*   `"rank"`
*   `"id"`

1.  [ ] Create and return a dictionary with the keys above.
2.  [ ] Assign each of the four inputs to the matching key, ie: `"name": name`.

Next, we can't have two characters named `bloodwarrior123`'s on the same server!

3.  [ ] For the fifth key, `id`, create a unique value as follows:

Concatenate the `name` and the `server` inputs with a `#` in the middle. For example, given:

*   name = "bloodwarrior123"
*   server = "server1"

Then the `id` field would be set to `bloodwarrior123#server1`.

## Tips

*   You can return the dictionary directly without assigning it to a variable.
*   I recommend using an `f-string` to create the `id` field. This is a best practice.

    record = {
        "name": name,
        "server": server,

    }

    return record
```

### ▶️ L2: Duplicate Keys

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

Because dictionaries rely on unique keys, you can't have two of the same key in the same dictionary. If you try to use the same key twice, the first value will simply be overwritten.

## Assignment

Another developer on our team has introduced a bug by specifying duplicate keys in the dictionary! _Fix the bug._

The `get_character_record` function takes a character's `name`, `server`, `level`, and `rank`. It should return a dictionary with the following fields:

*   name
*   server
*   level
*   rank
*   id

Where the `id` is the `name` and the `server` concatenated together with a `#` in the middle for uniqueness. We can't have two `bloodwarrior123`'s on the same server!

### ▶️ L3: Accessing Dictionary Values

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Dictionary elements must be accessible somehow in code, otherwise they wouldn't be very useful.

A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets. The square brackets look similar to indexing into a list.

```python
car = {
    "make": "Toyota",
    "model": "Camry"
}
print(car["make"])
# Prints: Toyota
```

</section>


### ▶️ L4: Setting Dictionary Values

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

You don't need to create a dictionary with values already inside. It is common to create a blank dictionary then populate it later using dynamic values. The syntax is the same as getting data out of a key, just use the assignment operator (`=`) to give that key a value.

```python
planets = {}
planets["Earth"] = True
planets["Pluto"] = False
print(planets["Pluto"])
# Prints False
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

Use the example below to answer the question:

```python
names = ["jack bronson", "jill mcarty", "john denver"]

names_dict = {}
for name in names:
    # .split() returns a list of strings
    # where each string is a single word from the original
    name_list = name.split()

    # here we update the dictionary
    names_dict[name_list[0]] = name_list[1]

print(names_dict)
# Prints: {'jack': 'bronson', 'jill': 'mcarty', 'john': 'denver'}
```

</section>

### ▶️ L5: Updating Dictionary Values

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

If you try to set the value of a key that already exists, you'll end up just updating the value of that key.

```python
planets = {
    "Pluto": True,
}
planets["Pluto"] = False
print(planets["Pluto"])
# Prints False
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

Use the example below to answer the question:

```python
full_names = ["jack bronson", "james mcarty", "jack denver"]

names_dict = {}
for full_name in full_names:
    # .split() returns a list of strings
    # where each string is a single word from the original
    names = full_name.split()
    first_name = names[0]
    last_name = names[1]
    names_dict[first_name] = last_name

print(names_dict)
# {
#   'jack': 'denver',
#   'james': 'mcarty'
# }
```

In this example, "denver" overwrote "bronson" as the value for the key "jack".

### ▶️ L6: Deleting Dictionary Values

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

You can delete existing keys using the `del` keyword.

```python
names_dict = {
    "jack": "bronson",
    "jill": "mcarty",
    "joe": "denver"
}

del names_dict["joe"]

print(names_dict)
# Prints: {'jack': 'bronson', 'jill': 'mcarty'}
```

## Deleting Keys That Don't Exist

Notice that if you try to delete a key that doesn't exist, you'll get an _error_.

```python
names_dict = {
    "jack": "bronson",
    "jill": "mcarty",
    "joe": "denver"
}

del names_dict["unknown"]
# ERROR HERE, key doesn't exist
```
