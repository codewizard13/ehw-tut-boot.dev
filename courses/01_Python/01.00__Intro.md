#### 1: Welcome to Learn Python

- Done

#### 2: Fix Your First Bug


#### 3: The Console


#### 4: What Is Python?


- https://www.python.org/
- https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology

- Python is known for: 

  - Backend web servers
  - DevOps and cloud engineering
  - Machine learning
  - Scripting and automation

  - Being simple to read and write
  
- Not well-known for:  frontend development or graphical user interfaces. It's possible, but not common.


#### 5: What Is Python?


#### 6: What Is 'Code'?

#### 7: Multiple Instructions


#### 8: Syntax Errors



> "Syntax" is jargon for "valid code that the computer can understand".

#### 9. Syntax Errors Quiz

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)

 in Python, the following is correct syntax:

 ```py
print("hello world")
 ```

Other types of errors besides syntax errors:

- **A bug in your logic**: Your code is valid, and will run, but it _does something unexpected._
- It's **too slow**. Your code is valid and does what's expected, but it does it slowly

What happens if you try to run code with invalid syntax?

- You'll get an error message from the Python interpreter and the code won't execute

#### 11. Lesson Failure



<span class="boot-dev-op">Boot.dev Instructions:</span>

Run: For testing and debugging. There is no penalty for running your code.
Submit: Runs your code, but also checks its output against our answer key. If the output doesn't match, you'll be punished.
Pro tip: You wouldn't deploy code to end users without testing... right? So don't submit code without running it first! The goal of this game mechanic is to encourage good real-world coding practices. "Submit" is like deploying to production.

What's the Penalty?
When you fail a lesson, one of two things will happen:

If you have armor, you'll lose one. That armor is consumed to protect you from future failures on that lesson.
If you don't have an armor, you'll lose your sharpshooter spree, and it will reset to zero. Each time your spree counter hits 15, you'll earn a random chest. Chests contain gems and items (like armor).
