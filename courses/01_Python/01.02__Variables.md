These are my personal notes on **variables in Learn to Code in Python** from Boot.dev. This chapter covers how to use **variables** to store and reuse data, the basics of **data types** like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`, and concepts like **f-strings**, `NoneType`, and **dynamic typing**. It also introduces proper **naming conventions**, **comments**, and clean multi-variable declarations.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L1: Variables

- https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html

- **variables:** how we store data as our program runs. Up 'till now we've been printing data by passing it straight into print(). Now we're going to save the data in variables so we can reuse it and change it before printing it. how we store data as our program runs. Up 'till now we've been printing data by passing it straight into print(). Now we're going to save the data in variables so we can reuse it and change it before printing it.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L2: Variables Vary


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L3: Storing Results


**common math operators in Python:**

```py
summation = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b    # Multiplication
quotient = a / b   # Division
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L4: Negative Numbers
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L5: Comments

**single line comments:**

```py
# speed describes how fast the player
# moves in meters per second
speed = 2
```

**multi-line comments ([docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/))**

- Use triple-quotes `"""` to wrap multi-line comments

```py
"""
    the code found below
    will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```




### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L6: Variable Names

Variable names can not have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, Guido van Rossum, [**implores us**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) to **use snake_case for variable names**. What is snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

| Name        | Description                                                   | Code          | Language(s) that recommend it |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Snake Case  | All words are lowercase and separated by underscores          | num_new_users | Python, Ruby, Rust            |
| Camel Case  | Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one | numNewUsers   | JavaScript, Java              |
| Pascal Case | Capitalize the first letter of each word                      | NumNewUsers   | C#, C++                       |
| No Casing   | All lowercase with no separation                              | numnewusers   | No one: don't do this         |

To be clear, your Python code will still work with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L7: Variable Names
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L8: Basic Variable Types


**Python basic data types:**


- **Strings**:  lists of characters strung together. We create strings by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes. That said, **double quotes are preferred**.

> üí° Note: Numbers aren't surrounded by quotes when they're declared

- **Integers**: a number without a decimal part
- **Floats**: a number with a decimal part
- **Booleans**: a type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. 




### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L9: <span style="color:brown; font-weight:700;">F-Strings in Python</span>


In Python, we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the [**f-string**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) syntax.

```py
num_bananas = 10
bananas = f"You have {num_bananas} bananas"
print(bananas)
# You have 10 bananas
```

- Add an f to the start of quotes to create an f-string: f"this is easy!"
- Use curly brackets {} around a variable to interpolate (put) its value into the string.
- Remember, it's just a string! Don't overthink it!


**F-strings** in Python are used for quoting multi-line strings similar to PHP **heredocs** and JavaScript **template literals**. 

Here's a clear comparison table showing how **PHP heredoc**, **JavaScript (ES6) template literals**, and **Python triple-quoted f-strings** are used for **multiline strings** and **string interpolation**:

| Language       | Feature                | Syntax Example                                                                      | Notes                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **PHP**        | Heredoc                | `php<br>$name = "Alice";<br>echo <<<TEXT<br>Hello, $name!<br>Welcome.<br>TEXT;<br>` | Supports **multiline** and **variables**.  |
| **JavaScript** | Template Literals      | ``js<br>let name = "Alice";<br>console.log(`Hello, ${name}!\nWelcome.`);<br>``      | Backticks allow **multiline** & `${}` vars |
| **Python**     | Triple-quoted f-string | `python<br>name = "Alice"<br>print(f"""Hello, {name}!\nWelcome.""")<br>`            | Use `f"""..."""` or `f'''...'''` for both. |



### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L10: <span style="color:brown; font-weight:700;">NoneType Variables</span>

We can make an "empty" variable by setting it to [**None**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None). None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. It is not the same as zero, False, or an empty string.

```py
my_none = None # this is a None-type
my_none = "None" # this is a string with the value "None"
```

> üí° Use **_is_** to **Check if variable is NoneType:**

```py
enemy = None

print(enemy is None)
```

> üí° Alternatively, use the `type()` function like so:

```py
age_selection = None
age_selection_str = "None"

print(type(age_selection))
print(type(age_selection_str))
```

Common use case: use NoneType as the default variable of a variable

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L11: NoneType Quiz


> üí° **#FUNCTION:** `input()` - Receive input from the console - similar to Perl's `STDIN`


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L12: Dynamic Typing

> üí°Most scripting languages (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.) are dynamically typed


- [**dynamically typed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_and_dynamic_type_checking_in_practice):  a variable that can store any type, adn that type can change (like PHP).
- [**statically types**](): if you try to assign a value to a variable of the wrong type, _**an error would crash the program**_. Can't be easily changed at runtime.

<span class="error-banner">In almost all circumstances, it's a bad idea to change the type of a variable. The "proper" thing to do is to just create a new one.</span>

Other statically typed languages:  Go, C, Typescript, Rust, etc.


Nowadays, its safer to write in statically typed languages and easier to ship code quickly due to tooling and type inference (the compiler infers the variable type) improvements.

Python great for learning programming because it reads like plain english and allows you to focus on the concepts you are trying to learn without extra layers of complexity (**type safety**, syntax, etc.).

- **type safety:** helps prevent bugs by ensuring variables are used consistently with their expected data types.

Here's an example with **Typescript:**

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

add(5, 10);      // ‚úÖ Works fine
add("5", 10);    // ‚ùå Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```

### What's happening:

* The function `add` expects two **numbers**.
* TypeScript enforces this at **compile time**, catching errors early before the code runs.

This is type safety in action ‚Äî it prevents you from accidentally passing the wrong types and helps avoid runtime bugs.




### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L13: Dynamic Typing

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L14: Math With Strings

In Python, the plus `+` operator performs concatenation between strings.

<span class="success-banner">Generally speaking, it's better to use string interpolation with `f-strings` over `+` concatenation.</span>


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L15: Multi-Variable Declaration

> üí°**#TIP:** We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring them on the same line:

```py
sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200
```

_**Any number of variables can be declared on the same line**_, and variables declared on the same line should be related to one another in some way so that the code remains easy to understand.

- **clean code:** code that's easy to understand


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L16: Multi-Variable Declaration

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L17: Boots

<span class="boot-dev-op">About Boots</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

You may have already figured this out by now, but below the lesson explanation (or in the Boots tab on mobile), there's an adorable bear-wizard named [**Boots**](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/e4fac74c-9d67-41ad-a85c-c579cb3ad76f#).

His job is to help you when if you get stuck. Here's how:

- **Boots is an AI chatbot, like ChatGPT, that's been trained on our lessons**. When you ask him a question, he already knows:
  - The official solution
  - What you've been asked to do
  - The changes you've made to the code in the editor

- He's been trained to not give you the answer (that's bad for learning), but instead to use the [**Socratic method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) to help you figure it out. He asks you follow up questions and explains fundamental concepts to keep you moving forward.

> ‚õî #GOTCHA: Chatting with Boots before you've completed a lesson costs a Baked Salmon (he's a hungry guy), or, if you don't have one, 50% of the XP that you'd earn from completing the lesson. You only need to pay once per lesson to start the conversation.

- Chatting with Boots **after you've completed a lesson is free**. Use this to ask follow up questions, review the concepts, or ask for more examples.

</section>

> üí°#TIP: Your code is automatically included in the message sent to Boots whenever you change it from the last time you asked Boots a question.



### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è L18: Spellbook

<span class="boot-dev-op">About Spellbook</span>

<section class="boot-dev-op-sec">

As you progress through Boot.dev, you might find yourself wanting to:

- Take notes
- Review concepts you already learned
- See more examples of a concept
- See an example of some syntax you already learned

Your [**spellbook**](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/cbd18c5e-236f-497a-a42e-e83810cc0f04#) solves these problems.

It's a **searchable cheatsheet** of everything you've learned on Boot.dev. As you complete lessons, you'll automatically unlock new pages in your spellbook that can be searched at any time. So, _**if you know what you're looking for, use your spellbook before chatting with Boots**_, because using the spellbook costs no items or XP!

</section>

- **spellbook**: searchable cheatsheet; a type of _**compendium**_
Certainly! Here's a concise and slightly more elaborated revision:

- **XP**: shorthand for *experience points*, a metric used to measure a player's progress, skill, or achievement in games and gamified systems.


- [**average**](https://www.mathsisfun.com/mean.html): (or "mean") calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by how many numbers there are.

### **Spellbook locations:**
- **Desktop**: bottom-right of the lesson text, you'll see a toggle to switch from Boots to your spellbook. Flip the switch to open your spellbook.
- **Mobile**: it's the last tab at the top of the screen.
