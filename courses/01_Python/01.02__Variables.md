### ▶️ L1: Variables

- https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html

- **variables:** how we store data as our program runs. Up 'till now we've been printing data by passing it straight into print(). Now we're going to save the data in variables so we can reuse it and change it before printing it. how we store data as our program runs. Up 'till now we've been printing data by passing it straight into print(). Now we're going to save the data in variables so we can reuse it and change it before printing it.

### ▶️ L2: Variables Vary


### ▶️ L3: Storing Results


**common math operators in Python:**

```py
summation = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b    # Multiplication
quotient = a / b   # Division
```

### ▶️ L4: Negative Numbers
### ▶️ L5: Comments

**single line comments:**

```py
# speed describes how fast the player
# moves in meters per second
speed = 2
```

**multi-line comments ([docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/))**

- Use triple-quotes `"""` to wrap multi-line comments

```py
"""
    the code found below
    will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```




### ▶️ L6: Variable Names

Variable names can not have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, Guido van Rossum, [**implores us**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) to **use snake_case for variable names**. What is snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

| Name        | Description                                                   | Code          | Language(s) that recommend it |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Snake Case  | All words are lowercase and separated by underscores          | num_new_users | Python, Ruby, Rust            |
| Camel Case  | Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one | numNewUsers   | JavaScript, Java              |
| Pascal Case | Capitalize the first letter of each word                      | NumNewUsers   | C#, C++                       |
| No Casing   | All lowercase with no separation                              | numnewusers   | No one: don't do this         |

To be clear, your Python code will still work with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

### ▶️ L7: Variable Names
### ▶️ L8: Basic Variable Types


**Python basic data types:**


- **Strings**:  lists of characters strung together. We create strings by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes. That said, **double quotes are preferred**.

> 💡 Note: Numbers aren't surrounded by quotes when they're declared

- **Integers**: a number without a decimal part
- **Floats**: a number with a decimal part
- **Booleans**: a type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. 




### ▶️ L9: <span style="color:brown; font-weight:700;">F-Strings in Python</span>

In Python, we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the [**f-string**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) syntax.

```py
num_bananas = 10
bananas = f"You have {num_bananas} bananas"
print(bananas)
# You have 10 bananas
```

- Add an f to the start of quotes to create an f-string: f"this is easy!"
- Use curly brackets {} around a variable to interpolate (put) its value into the string.
- Remember, it's just a string! Don't overthink it!
