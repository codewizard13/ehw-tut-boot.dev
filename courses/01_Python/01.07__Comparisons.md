### ▶️ L1: Comparison Operators

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

# Comparison Operators

When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. `Boolean logic` is the name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in `True` or `False`.

The operators:

*   `<` "less than"
*   `>` "greater than"
*   `<=` "less than or equal to"
*   `>=` "greater than or equal to"
*   `==` "equal to"
*   `!=` "not equal to"

For example:

```py
5 < 6 # evaluates to True
5 > 6 # evaluates to False
5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
5 == 6 # evaluates to False
5 != 6 # evaluates to True
```

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `player_1_wins` function. It should return `True` if player 1 has a higher score, and `False` otherwise.

</section>


<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *Comparing two strings in Python using `<` or `>` can be useful for **sorting** because it uses the string's **unicode value***

- **unicode code point**: a specific number that stands for a text character, so computers know exactly which character you mean; starting with "U+" and then the number in hexadecimal (base 16).

<section class="info-banner"><span>💡 PRO TIP: </span>

"**Unicode code points**" are unique numbers that represent every character in the Unicode system, which is a standard used by computers to handle text from almost all languages and symbols.[1][2][3]

When you type or store text, each letter, digit, punctuation mark, emoji, etc., has its own code point—a specific number assigned to it. For example:
- The letter "A" is code point U+0041.
- The letter "a" is code point U+0061.
- The emoji 💩 is code point U+1F4A9.


</section>

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def player_1_wins(player_1_score, player_2_score):
    return player_1_score > player_2_score
```

### ▶️ L2: Comparison Operator Evaluations

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

When a comparison happens, the result of the comparison is just a boolean value, it's either `True` or `False`.

Take the following two examples:

```py
is_bigger = 5 > 4
```

```py
is_bigger = True
```

In both of the above cases, we're creating a `Boolean` variable called `is_bigger` with a value of `True`.

Because `5` is greater than `4`, `is_bigger` is assigned the value of `True`.


</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Create the following variables. Use comparison operators to determine their boolean values. The context of the parameter names should tell you how to make these comparisons. Return them in this order:

1.  `is_mustang_edward_same`
2.  `is_alphonse_edward_same`
3.  `is_winry_alphonse_same`

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def compare_heights(edward_height, alphonse_height, winry_height, mustang_height):
    is_mustang_edward_same = mustang_height == edward_height
    is_alphonse_edward_same = alphonse_height == edward_height
    is_winry_alphonse_same = winry_height == alphonse_height
    return is_mustang_edward_same, is_alphonse_edward_same, is_winry_alphonse_same
```

```py
car_size = 4
truck_size = 5
is_smaller = car_size < truck_size
# is_smaller is True
```

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>


## Assignment

Complete the `can_withstand_blow` function. It should return `True` if the hero's armor is greater than or equal to the damage dealt by the enemy, and `False` otherwise.

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def can_withstand_blow(hero_armor, enemy_damage):
    return hero_armor >= enemy_damage
```

</section>

### ▶️ L4: If Statements

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

It's often useful to only execute code if a certain condition is met:

```py
if CONDITION:
	# do some stuff here

# code after the if block may still run regardless
```

For example, in this code:

```py
def show_status(boss_health):
    if boss_health > 0:
        print("Ganondorf is alive!")
        return
    print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

if `boss_health` is greater than `0`, then this will be printed:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is alive!
```

Otherwise, this will be printed:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is unalive!
```

Without a `return` in the `if` block, `Ganondorf is unalive` would always be printed:

```py
def show_status(boss_health):
    if boss_health > 0:
        print("Ganondorf is alive!")
    print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

This code could print both messages:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is alive!
Ganondorf is unalive!
```

When you only want code within an `if` block to run, use `return` to exit the function early.

</section>


<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *When you **only want code within an if block to run**, use **return** to exit the function early. (Without a return in an if block, the code immediately following it would always execute, instead of conditionally).*

<br>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `print_status` function.

*   If `player_health` is less than or equal to `0`, _print_ the text `dead` to the console.
*   Afterwards, whether or not the player is dead, _print_ the text `status check complete` to the console.

> 💡 **TIP**: *Also, **don't forget the colon** after your if statement `:` it is a required part of the syntax!*

### ▶️ L5: If Practice





### ▶️ L6: If-Else


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>


An `if` statement can be followed by zero or more `elif` (which stands for "else if") statements, which can be followed by zero or one `else` statements.

For example:

```py
if score > high_score:
    print("High score beat!")
elif score > second_highest_score:
    print("You got second place!")
elif score > third_highest_score:
    print("You got third place!")
else:
    print("Better luck next time")
```

First the `if` statement is evaluated. If it is `True` then the if statement's body is executed and all the other `elif`s and the `else` are ignored.

If the first `if` is false then the next `elif` is evaluated. Likewise, if it is `True` then its body is executed and the rest are ignored.

If none of the `if` or `elif` statements evaluate to `True` then the final `else` statement will be the only body executed.

- **elif**: Python's version of `else if` / `elsif` in other languages.

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `player_status` function. If the player's `health` is less than or equal to `0`, `return` the string:

```
dead
```

Otherwise, if it's less than or equal to `5` `return` the string:

```
injured
```

Otherwise, `return` the string:

```
healthy
```
