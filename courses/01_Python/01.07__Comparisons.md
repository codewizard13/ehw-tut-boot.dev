### ▶️ L1: Comparison Operators

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

# Comparison Operators

When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. `Boolean logic` is the name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in `True` or `False`.

The operators:

*   `<` "less than"
*   `>` "greater than"
*   `<=` "less than or equal to"
*   `>=` "greater than or equal to"
*   `==` "equal to"
*   `!=` "not equal to"

For example:

```py
5 < 6 # evaluates to True
5 > 6 # evaluates to False
5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
5 == 6 # evaluates to False
5 != 6 # evaluates to True
```

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `player_1_wins` function. It should return `True` if player 1 has a higher score, and `False` otherwise.

</section>


<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *Comparing two strings in Python using `<` or `>` can be useful for **sorting** because it uses the string's **unicode value***

- **unicode code point**: a specific number that stands for a text character, so computers know exactly which character you mean; starting with "U+" and then the number in hexadecimal (base 16).

<section class="info-banner"><span>💡 PRO TIP: </span>

"**Unicode code points**" are unique numbers that represent every character in the Unicode system, which is a standard used by computers to handle text from almost all languages and symbols.[1][2][3]

When you type or store text, each letter, digit, punctuation mark, emoji, etc., has its own code point—a specific number assigned to it. For example:
- The letter "A" is code point U+0041.
- The letter "a" is code point U+0061.
- The emoji 💩 is code point U+1F4A9.

```

### ▶️ L2: Comparison Operator Evaluations

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

When a comparison happens, the result of the comparison is just a boolean value, it's either `True` or `False`.

Take the following two examples:

```py
is_bigger = 5 > 4
```

```py
is_bigger = True
```

In both of the above cases, we're creating a `Boolean` variable called `is_bigger` with a value of `True`.

Because `5` is greater than `4`, `is_bigger` is assigned the value of `True`.


</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Create the following variables. Use comparison operators to determine their boolean values. The context of the parameter names should tell you how to make these comparisons. Return them in this order:

1.  `is_mustang_edward_same`
2.  `is_alphonse_edward_same`
3.  `is_winry_alphonse_same`

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def compare_heights(edward_height, alphonse_height, winry_height, mustang_height):
    is_mustang_edward_same = mustang_height == edward_height
    is_alphonse_edward_same = alphonse_height == edward_height
    is_winry_alphonse_same = winry_height == alphonse_height
    return is_mustang_edward_same, is_alphonse_edward_same, is_winry_alphonse_same
```

## Assignment

Complete the `can_withstand_blow` function. It should return `True` if the hero's armor is greater than or equal to the damage dealt by the enemy, and `False` otherwise.

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def can_withstand_blow(hero_armor, enemy_damage):
    return hero_armor >= enemy_damage
```

</section>

### ▶️ L4: If Statements

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

It's often useful to only execute code if a certain condition is met:

```py
if CONDITION:
	# do some stuff here

# code after the if block may still run regardless
```

For example, in this code:

```py
def show_status(boss_health):
    if boss_health > 0:
        print("Ganondorf is alive!")
        return
    print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

if `boss_health` is greater than `0`, then this will be printed:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is alive!
```

Otherwise, this will be printed:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is unalive!
```

Without a `return` in the `if` block, `Ganondorf is unalive` would always be printed:

```py
def show_status(boss_health):
    if boss_health > 0:
        print("Ganondorf is alive!")
    print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

This code could print both messages:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is alive!
Ganondorf is unalive!
```

When you only want code within an `if` block to run, use `return` to exit the function early.

</section>


<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *When you **only want code within an if block to run**, use **return** to exit the function early. (Without a return in an if block, the code immediately following it would always execute, instead of conditionally).*

<br>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `print_status` function.

*   If `player_health` is less than or equal to `0`, _print_ the text `dead` to the console.
*   Afterwards, whether or not the player is dead, _print_ the text `status check complete` to the console.

### ▶️ L5: If Practice


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Remember, you can use the `==` operator to check if two values are equal. For example:

```py
is_equal = 5 == 5
# is_equal is True
```

## Tip

You only need to use one `if` statement and two `return` statements to complete the function.

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `check_swords_for_army` function. If the number of swords and the number of soldiers match, return the string:

```
correct amount
```

Otherwise, return the string:

```
incorrect amount
```

Punctuation matters! Make sure you return the strings exactly as they appear above.

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def check_swords_for_army(number_of_swords, number_of_soldiers):
    pass
```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
def check_swords_for_army(number_of_swords, number_of_soldiers):
    if number_of_swords == number_of_soldiers:
        return "correct amount"
    return "incorrect amount"
```

</section><!-- END .assignment-answer-sec -->


### ▶️ L6: If-Else


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>


An `if` statement can be followed by zero or more `elif` (which stands for "else if") statements, which can be followed by zero or one `else` statements.

For example:

```py
if score > high_score:
    print("High score beat!")
elif score > second_highest_score:
    print("You got second place!")
elif score > third_highest_score:
    print("You got third place!")
else:
    print("Better luck next time")
```

First the `if` statement is evaluated. If it is `True` then the if statement's body is executed and all the other `elif`s and the `else` are ignored.

If the first `if` is false then the next `elif` is evaluated. Likewise, if it is `True` then its body is executed and the rest are ignored.

If none of the `if` or `elif` statements evaluate to `True` then the final `else` statement will be the only body executed.

</section>

<br>

- **elif**: Python's version of `else if` / `elsif` in other languages.

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

Complete the `player_status` function. If the player's `health` is less than or equal to `0`, `return` the string:

```
dead
```

Otherwise, if it's less than or equal to `5` `return` the string:

```
injured
```

Otherwise, `return` the string:

```
healthy
```

</section>

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py
def player_status(health):
    pass
```

**✍️ MY ANSWER:**

```py
def player_status(health):
    if health <= 0:
        return "dead"
    elif health <= 5:
        return "injured"
    else:
        return "healthy"
```

### ▶️ L7: If-Else Practice


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>


Here are some basic rules with if/else blocks.

*   You can't have an `elif` or an `else` without an `if`
*   You **_can_** have an `else` without an `elif`

Remember, to check if two values are the same use the `==` operator.

```py
same = 5 == 6
# same is False

same = 6 == 6
# same is True
```

</section>

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

There is a bug in the `check_high_score` function! Add the proper conditional statement to fix the bug. If the names match, return the string:

```
You are the highest scoring player!
```

Otherwise, return:

```
You are not the highest scoring player!
```

</section>

<br>

> 💡 **TIP**: *The `<=` operator compares strings _alphabetically_ and works when names are equal (e.g., "lane" <= "lane" is True).*

<br>

<section class="assignment-answer-sec">

**✍️ ASSIGNMENT STARTING CODE:**

<span class="code-filename">main.py</span>

```py

### ▶️ L9: Boolean Logic


<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">COPIED VERBATIM:  👇🏽</span>

Boolean logic refers to logic dealing with boolean (`True` or `False`) values. For example,

Dogs must have four legs _and_ weigh less than 100 kilograms. (Both conditions must be true)

Cars are cool if they go faster than 200 MPH, _or_ if they are electric. (At least one condition must be true)

## Logical Operators Review

As we discussed earlier, the logical operators `and` and `or` can be used to perform boolean logic.

### And Review

The `and` operator returns `True` if _both_ of the conditions on either side evaluates to `True`:

```py
def is_dog(num_legs, weight):
    return num_legs == 4 and weight < 100
```

Let's go over how this function evaluates the parameters `num_legs=4` and `weight=99`:

```py
return 4 == 4 and 99 < 100
```

```py
return True and True
```

```py
return True
```

Let's see what would happen with `3` and `98` instead:

```py
return 3 == 4 and 98 < 100
```

```py
return False and True
```

```py
return False
```

### Or Review

The `or` operator returns `True` if _at least one_ of the conditions on either side evaluates to `True`:

```py
def is_car_cool(speed, is_electric):
    return speed > 200 or is_electric
```

Let's use a non-electric car that can do 250:

```py
return 250 > 200 or False
```

```py
return True or False
```

```py
return True
```

## Tip



</section>

<BR>

<section class="info-banner"><span>💡 PRO TIP </span>

*Remember that you can define the order of operations using **parentheses**:*

should_admit = (high_gpa and high_sat_score) or (is_rich)
```

## Assignment

We need a way for our game to track whether a character's attack hits or misses.

Complete the `does_attack_hit` function. The function should return `True` if _either_ of the following conditions are met:

*   The `attack_roll` is _not_ a `1` _and_ the attack roll is greater than or equal to the `armor_class`, or
*   The attack roll is a `20`

Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### ▶️ L10: Boolean Quiz



### ▶️ L11: Should Serve Drinks

<section class="callout"><span class="label-verbatim">Assignment:  👇🏽</span>

## Assignment

In Fantasy Quest, players can go to a town's local pub. Drinking virtual beer refills their stamina!

Complete the function that determines if a bartender should serve drinks to a customer. Only return `True` if all of these conditions apply. If any of these conditions are `False`, return `False`:

*   The customer's age is 21 or older
*   The bartender is working
*   The time is between 5 and 10 o'clock (inclusive)

## Tips

### Understand the Problem

This assignment tests your ability to think critically by challenging your expectations up to this point. First, understand the problem before rushing to conclusions about the requirements. Then, convert these positive conditions into negatives. Finally, convert them into code.

1.  If the customer's age is less than 21, return `False`.
2.  If the bartender is on break, return `False`.
3.  If the `time` is before 5 or after 10, return `False`.
4.  Return `True`.

Why go through the hassle of _**inverting the logic**_? The alternative is to write a function that is deeply nested and therefore less readable and more confusing than the solution.

```py
def check_conditions(condition_1, condition_2, condition_3):
    if condition_1:
        if not condition_2:
            if condition_3 > 1:
                return True
    return False
```

### If Statements Don't Need a Comparison

Where "is\_big" is a `boolean` value, the following statements are identical:

```py
if is_big:
    # ...
```

```py
if is_big == True:
    # ...
```

The first option should be preferred due to length; however, the second is more readable. The `== True` is _redundant_.

- **chanined comparison**: a single expression combining multiple comparison operators in sequence, such as `a < b < c`, which is evaluated as `(a < b) and (b < c)`.

<br>

> 💡 **TIP**:   *True **chained comparisons with range semantics** is native only in a few languages (Java, Perl 5/6, Mathematica).*


<section class="info-banner"><span>💡 PRO TIP:  </span>

<BR>

> *Although some languages like JavaScript, C, and C++ allow a similar looking syntax, it doesn't evaluate like true chained comparison languages do.*

### Concrete examples demonstrating different evaluation rules:

- **Python**: Supports true chained comparisons like `a < b < c`, which evaluate as `(a < b) and (b < c)` but with short-circuiting and only evaluating `b` once. This is a **logical, range-based evaluation**.[10][11]

- **JavaScript**: Supports chained comparison syntax, but evaluates each comparison separately with **implicit coercion**. For example:
  ```js
  1 < 2 < 3  // evaluates as (1 < 2) -> true, coerced to 1; then 1 < 3 -> true
  ```
  So, it produces booleans, not a true range check, and behaves differently from Python.[12][13]

- **C, C++, Java**: These languages do **not** have native chained comparison support. Expressions like `a < b < c` are **evaluated as** `(a < b)`, which produces a boolean, then that boolean is compared with `c`, often leading to unintended logic errors. For example:
  ```cpp
  if (a < b < c) { ... }
  ```
  Is parsed as `(a < b) < c`, with `(a < b)` yielding `true` or `false` (0 or 1), then comparing that to `c`, which is not the intended range comparison.[14]

- **Mathematica**: Supports chained comparisons natively, similar to Python, e.g., `a < b < c` is a true range evaluation.[14]

- **Raku (Perl 6)**: Supports true chained comparisons, with evaluation similar to Python.[15]

### Summary:
- Languages like **Python** and **Mathematica** support *true* chained comparisons with range semantics.
- Many **imperative languages** (Java, C, C++) do **not** support chained comparisons; they evaluate as separate expressions with different logic rules.
- **JavaScript**, despite syntax, evaluates chained comparisons as separate, coerced, boolean expressions rather than a true range.[13][12]

This supports the statement that expressions similar to Python's chained comparisons do **not** evaluate the same way in most languages.

- **Python**: A high-level, interpreted programming language known for readability and expressiveness, with native support for chained comparisons.

- **Mathematica**: A symbolic computational software language and environment that supports mathematical operations, including native chained comparisons.

- **JavaScript**: A widely-used scripting language primarily for web development; allows chained comparison syntax but with different evaluation rules than Python.

- **coercion**: The implicit or automatic conversion of a value from one data type to another during evaluation.

- **range check**: A logical operation to determine if a value falls within a specified interval between two bounds.

- **imperative languages**: Programming languages that use statements to change a program's state, often following the procedural programming paradigm (e.g., C, Java).

- **logical operators**: Operators that perform logical operations on boolean values, such as AND, OR, and NOT.

- **boolean**: A data type with two possible values: True or False, used in logic and condition evaluation.

- **short-circuiting**: An evaluation strategy where the evaluation stops as soon as the overall truth value is determined from left to right.

- **syntax**: The set of rules defining the structure of valid expressions and statements in a programming language.

- **evaluation**: The process of computing the result of an expression according to a language's semantics and rules.

- **expression**: A combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produce a value when evaluated.
